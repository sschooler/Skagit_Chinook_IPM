## Skagit Chinook IPM: Integrated Population Models with application to Skagit River Chinook Salmon Recovery Evaluation 

The code here will allow anyone to reproduce results from the final project report for EPA Near-Term Action (NTA) 2018-0697. The goal of this project was to develop, apply, and evaluate a Bayesian state-space life cycle IPM for Skagit River Chinook Salmon (_Oncorhynchus tshawytscha_) to enable inference about population dynamics from multiple sources of life stage specific data including age composition, smolt abundance, escapement, and harvest.
